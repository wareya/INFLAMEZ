# minus-10-DEX

post-jam TODO:
- make the crazy reroute not have a frameperfect-feeling jump on it
- fix the coyote time walljump bug
- make walljumps have a 2.5 pixel buffer instead of a 1.5 pixel buffer
- expand coyote time to 50ms
- make spikes not touch you when torch is out (at least on assist mode)
- make trinkets inaccessible when torch is out
- move the "ledge jump" torch so that it's not implying that it's necessary to ledge jump
- make unlit torches brighter somehow
