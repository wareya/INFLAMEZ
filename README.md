# minus-10-DEX

post-jam TODO:
- fix the coyote time walljump bug
- make walljumps have a 2.5 pixel buffer instead of a 1.5 pixel buffer
- expand coyote time to 50ms
- make spikes not knock you back when torch is out (at least on assist mode)
- make unlit torches brighter somehow
- tweak spike knockback code (replace spikes with objects instead of tiles)
